Data used in this project, comes from  [Kaggle - Pokemon With Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon)

In this project, i am doing some basic Data Exploratory Anaysis on the above dataset. I am trying to understand the differences between pokemons based on their Generation and based on being a legendary one or not.

Also i am using some Machine Learning algorithms in order to guess if a pokemon is Legndary or not.
